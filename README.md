# Open-Source-Guidelines

Students, we want you!

EduCaffe is an mentoring organization for technical and business students. From the last 6 months we have mentored 500+ students from various colleges and various countries.

Our team is working 50 hrs a week to mentor students to choose their domains and work with top open source organisations.
 We at EduCaffe works with top notch devs and business students we write code, invest in funds , stocks , shares and have fun. Be part of our diverse organization and join efforts into keeping the project buzzing and mentoring :)

We explicitly encourage female students to apply.

To get a feeling for what EduCaffe do see our website www.educaffe.com by developers and students.

How to get started?

First step to get involved: -
THE best way to start is to solve entrance tasks. We do not consider students who have not written any kind of code in the run. In addition to your "technical application", we have mentioned some points which u have to be particular about.

The best tip for your application: rather than contacting us and asking what to do, send a patch! :) at https://goo.gl/forms/UEry9vm3bv3mFUPL2

Please do not contact developers directly , but always use the mailing list at educaffe00@gmail.com or whatsapp us at 9671034145

See here for the list of participating students and mentors.

Main focus of this year is to change the way of education 

As in 2018 we have worked on ios , flutter apps and games. New theme will be the with other open-source ML/AI/data tools/flutter.

OUR goal, apart from improving education system, is to recruit new long-term developers. If you can show us that you are likely to become a regular contributor for EduCaffe(by getting involved early, showing curiosity beyond your project, getting involved in work on releases, answering other users' questions), that will supercharge your chances getting selected and delivering a kick-ass project.

For this year:-

Focus on usability: We want to make EduCaffe easier to use for end-users, algorithm developers, and other open-source projects. This means working on user-API, documentation, error handling, default parameters, and examples AR ,VR and mobile apps. We want to make it easier for budding developers to write new algorithms. This means working on modernizing the core framework and the internal API, but also includes adding new interfaces, and working on a plugin-based architecture. This means working gluing APIs together. Finally, we want to continue on improving the quality of the education-base, in particular algorithms that either crash, are slow, or otherwise unreliable.

Focus on students: We aim to have fewer students (aiming at 3-4 core projects + 1-2 application projects!) - intense mentoring, interaction between students, blogging and documenting for individual students.

Focus on applications: Despite having had only limited success, we are still trying to push the idea for some real life ML problems in our education system. If you have a cool idea, let us know. Due to problems in earlier months, we will however set the bars higher.
Community efforts!

In addition to the individual projects, all students will be required to:

 on a weekly basis
peer-review a fellow student's work.
Write weekly blog posts
have a good time web-socializing with the other students
What we expect

EduCaffe is a marathon, not a sprint, and we expect good performance over the whole project. This means that you are in daily contact with the community and that you work 40 hours per week (you are paid after all!) We have compiled a list of deliverables that every student will have to satisfy.
